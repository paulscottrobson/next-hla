Expressions
===========

Sequence of the following :

Terms
=====

	<variable>					contents
	@<variable>					address
	<constant>					constant
	"xxxxx"						asciiz strings

Operators
=========

All operators are binary

+ - * / 						arithmetic
& | ^							binary (values, not logical)
! 								indirect lookup 

Identifiers
===========

first character $ a-z
remainder 		_  a-z 0-9

Variables
=========

Identifiers, procedures and variables are defined by usage. global variables have a '$' prefix. All procedures are global.

Procedures
==========

procedures are defined with proc <name>(<parameter list>) 
endproc compiles return, it does not enclose procedure code
procedures are called with <name>(<terms>)	

all procedures xxxx_boot() are called without parameters, in order, in the main program.

xxxx.boot(a,b,c) may be used for oop extension, where it is syntactically changed to <type>.boot(xxxx,a,b,c)

Instructions
==========
<variable> = <expr>								Assignment
<variable>!<term> = <expr>
<name>(parameters)								Invoke procedure
while(expr[#<=]0):endwhile						Conditional loop
if(expr[#<=0]):endif							Code test
for(expr):next 									Repeat n times, available in index, if defined. Counts n-1 to 0.sw
